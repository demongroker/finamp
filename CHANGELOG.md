# Changelog

All notable changes to Jellyamp are documented here, grouped by
**Added / Changed / Fixed / Security**, following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).
Tags are semver (`vX.Y.Z`) — the in-app update checker parses them.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-16
### Added
- **Core hardening milestone** — completes the P0 power-user audit:
  - `downloaded:true/false` search filter (via the download store)
  - Album quality semantics — an album matches `codec:`/`bit:` only when ALL its tracks do
  - Transcoding explanation — track sheet shows source → output → reason
  - Search result limits ("View all N") + stale-query auto-dispose
### Fixed
- Search `codec:`/`bit:`/`year:` filters now work (were reading missing MediaSources/ProductionYear fields)

## [0.9.37] - 2026-08-16
